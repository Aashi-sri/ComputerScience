<p> Ila Sachani was born in Amreli, Gujarat, in a farmer's family.But she was born with a physical challenge-- Both her hands were hanging loose by her sides.
Thus, she could not do day-to-day things like, playing, writing easily. But she did not lose hope. In fact, she was dedicated to overcome her challenge.
It was Ila's mother and grandmother who had encouraged her to conquer her obstacle. They decided to teach Ila the traditional art of Kathiawar embroidery.
They focused on teaching her creat many beautiful patterns with her feet! Her parents taught her do simle things using her legs like writing on the slate
board with chalk, eating food etc.She learned many styles; even ones from outside Gujarat --- Kachhi, Kashmiri etc.</p>

<p>For Ila, embroidery was a way to express herself to the world. The news about Ila's secial, hidden talent and skill, and the admiration for her work began
to spread like wildfire in her village. Word reached the government office, in Surat. They were moved by Ila's story and were impressed by her artwork.
They decided to display some samples of Ila's embroidery at a state exhibition. This experience was like opening a new door for Ila. People from different
corners of the world observed the beauty and readily purchased the creations.Now Ila was no more a hidden talent, but famous!</p>

<p>Encouraged, Ila participated in exhibitions at state level, national level etc. She recieved many rewards for both her willpower and creativity her beautiful
creation showed. Ila Sachani, once a farmer's daughter facing a tough challenge , now became a celebrated artist and reciever of the President's Medal, all
beacause she was dedicated and worked hard.</p>

<p>Her embroidery, created with her feet, even today, reminds us that art has the power to rise above physical challenges and touch the soul.</p></h2s>
